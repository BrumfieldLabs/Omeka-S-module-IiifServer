Deepzoom
=======

Tile generator for use with [OpenSeadragon], [OpenLayers] and various viewers.

This library can be used as a standalone tool, or with the open source digital
library [Omeka S] via the module [IIIF Server].


Example of implementation
-------------------------

```php
    // Setup the Zoomify library.
    $processor = new \Deepzoom\Deepzoom($config);

    // Process a source file and save tiles in a destination folder.
    $result = $processor->process($source, $destination);
```

Supported image libraries
-------------------------

The format of the image source can be anything that is managed by the image
libray:

- PHP Extension [GD] (>=2.0)
- PHP extension [Imagick] (>=6.0)
- Command line `convert` [ImageMagick] (>=6.0)

The PHP library `exif` should be installed (generally enabled by default).

History
-------

The source is a mix of the Laravel plugin [Deepzoom] of Jeremy Tubbs, the
standalone open zoom builder [Deepzoom.php] of Nicolas Fabre, the [blog] of
Olivier Mariott, and the [Zoomify converter].


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup and to check your files and your databases
regularly so you can roll back if needed.
